# NLP Text Classification Project

## 1. Problem Statement
The objective of this project is to classify text samples based on a labeled dataset using NLP techniques. This project demonstrates how to approach text classification tasks by processing textual data, training classification models, and evaluating their performance.

## 2. Data Sources
- **Dataset**: The dataset used in this project comes from *kaggle competitions download -c tweet-sentiment-extraction*
- **Data Structure**: It contains textual data with labels for classification.
- **Data Challenges**: Text data preprocessing is essential, addressing issues like stopwords, stemming, lemmatization, and feature extraction.

## 3. Approach to Solution
- **Methodology**: The project includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), text vectorization, model training, and evaluation.
- **Tools and Libraries**: Python with libraries such as Pandas for data handling, NLTK/Spacy for NLP preprocessing, and Scikit-Learn for model training and evaluation.
- **Models Used**: Models such as Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Logistic Regression were trained on the vectorized text data.

## 4. Results and Conclusions
- **Results**: The trained models achieved high accuracy, with insights on model effectiveness for text classification tasks.
- **Insights**: The EDA revealed important features in the text, and model evaluation provided guidance on which algorithms perform well on this dataset.
- **Conclusion**: This project successfully showcases text classification in NLP, highlighting areas for future improvement, such as deep learning models or enhanced preprocessing techniques.
